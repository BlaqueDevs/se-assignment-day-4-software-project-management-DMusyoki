## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods for Ensuring Quality Assurance (QA) in a Software Project

- Requirement Analysis and Clear Documentation – Ensuring well-defined requirements from the start helps prevent misunderstandings and defects.
- Automated Testing – Using tools like Selenium, JUnit, or Cypress to run repetitive tests quickly and efficiently.
- Manual Testing – QA testers perform functional, usability, and exploratory testing to catch issues that automation might miss.
- Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) – Automating code integration, testing, and deployment using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD.
Why Maintaining High Standards is Important
- User Satisfaction – A well-functioning, bug-free product leads to a better user experience.
- Brand Reputation – Poor-quality software can harm a company’s credibility and trustworthiness.
- Cost Savings – Fixing bugs early in development is far cheaper than post-release fixes.
- Security & Compliance – Maintaining quality standards ensures the software meets regulatory and security requirements.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
How Defining the Project Scope Contributes to Successful Project Planning
- Prevents Scope Creep – Clearly defining what is included (and excluded) in the project helps prevent uncontrolled expansion of requirements.
- Sets Clear Expectations – Ensures alignment among stakeholders, developers, and clients on deliverables and objectives.
- Improves Resource Allocation – Helps in assigning the right personnel, time, and budget for each phase of the project.
